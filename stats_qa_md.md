# Statistics and Probability - Questions and Answers

## 1.1 Identify 3 situations or issues in your workplace that can be dealt with through statistical methods

| Situation/Issue | Type of Statistics |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Population/Census: counting the number of people in a country, region, town or any given specific area | Descriptive Statistics |
| Weather Forecast values/Predictions: the chances of how the outside atmospheric representation will likely be | Inferential Statistics |
| Type of cars that are selling highly in a certain season in a given year | Both Description and Inferential Statistics |

## 1.2 Explain how forecasting plays a role in your business unit and organisation

A forecast can play a major role in driving company success or failure. At the base level, an accurate forecast keeps prices low by optimizing a business operation - cash flow, production, staff, and financial management. It helps reduce uncertainty and anticipate change in the market as well as improves internal communication, as well as communication between a business and their customers. It also helps increase knowledge of the market for businesses. Moreover, a promising forecast is compelling to investors who might be interested in putting money into a business.

## 2.1 Explain what is meant by a "trend"

A trend is a general direction in which something is developing or changing over time. In statistics, it refers to a pattern or tendency in data that can be observed across a series of measurements, indicating an increase, decrease, or stabilization.

## 2.2 What "trend" has been identified by Stats SA according to this article?

The trend identified by Stats SA is a decrease in civil judgments and summonses for debt. Specifically, there was a 15.8% decrease in civil judgments and a 16.4% decrease in civil summonses issued for debt in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004.

## 2.3 Explain what is meant by a "series"

A series refers to a sequence of data points collected over time, typically at regular intervals. In this article, the "series" is the monthly data released by Stats SA on civil cases for debt, which includes the number of cases recorded, summonses issued, judgments recorded, and the value of those judgments.

## 2.4 List the indicators of debt mentioned in the article

- Number of civil cases recorded
- Number of civil summonses issued for debt
- Number of civil judgments recorded for debt
- Value of civil judgments recorded for debt

## 2.5 Explain the difference between a census and a sample

A census is a study that collects data from every member of the population of interest. A sample is a study that collects data from only a subset (a smaller group) of the population, which is selected to represent the whole population.

## 2.6 You want to undertake a statistical study of absenteeism in your company. Would you take a census or a sample?

I would take a sample. 

**Reasons:**
- A census of all employees would be very time-consuming and expensive.
- If the company is large, it may be practically impossible to get complete data from everyone.
- A well-designed, representative sample can provide accurate results that are very close to what a census would find, but much more efficiently.

## 2.7 In order to collect a representative sample from your team/business unit, how many members would you have to survey?

I would survey all members of my team/business unit. The team is likely small enough (e.g., less than 50 people) that surveying everyone is feasible and ensures the sample is perfectly representative of the team. There is no need to sample a subset of a small, accessible population.

There is a total of 25 learners in our class, so I would survey 30% of the members and make sure the 30% chosen reflect the whole 25 learners. The sample size would be 8.

## 2.8 In order to collect a representative sample from your company, how many employees would you have to survey?

For a company of 500 employees, I would use a sample size formula or a sample size table. A common rule of thumb for large populations (over 10,000) is a sample of around 384 for a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level. For a mid-size company like this, a sample of ~217 employees would be sufficient for a 5% margin of error. I would use stratified sampling to ensure all departments and levels are proportionally represented.

## 3.2 Draw up a 10-point checklist for questionnaire criteria

1. ✓ Are questions clear and unambiguous?
2. ✓ Is the language simple and easy to understand?
3. ✓ Are leading or biased questions avoided?
4. ✓ Does the questionnaire have a logical flow?
5. ✓ Are the response options appropriate (e.g., covers all possibilities)?
6. ✓ Is the questionnaire a reasonable length?
7. ✓ Are instructions for the respondent clear?
8. ✓ Does it include necessary demographic questions?
9. ✓ Has it been pre-tested (piloted)?
10. ✓ Is the layout clean and easy to follow?

## 3.3 Likert scale - Is this an acceptable survey design?

**Survey Scale:** 10 (very interesting), 6 (above average), 4 (below average), 1 (not worth studying)

**Answer:** No, this is not an acceptable survey design. 

A standard Likert scale offers a balanced range of symmetric agree/disagree options (e.g., Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree). This design uses arbitrary numbers (10, 6, 4, 1) with unequal intervals between them (a gap of 4 between 10-6 and 6-4, but a gap of 3 between 4-1). This forces respondents to translate their feelings into the survey designer's numeric system rather than choosing from balanced descriptive options, which can lead to measurement error and misinterpretation of the data.

## 4. Discuss possible bias when interviewing your team for a survey

**From their side (Respondent Bias):**
- **Social Desirability Bias:** They might answer in a way they believe makes them look more responsible or hardworking to their manager (e.g., under-reporting absenteeism).
- **Recall Bias:** They might not accurately remember past events (e.g., exact reasons for absences).

**From my side (Interviewer Bias):**
- My tone of voice, body language, or reactions could unconsciously influence their answers.
- I might unintentionally probe more deeply for answers that confirm my own preconceptions about the causes of absenteeism.

**Other causes:**
- **Sampling Bias:** If I only interview certain people (e.g., those at their desks), I miss those who are absent more often.
- **Question Order Bias:** The order of questions can influence how later questions are answered.
- **Non-response Bias:** People who choose not to participate may have different absenteeism patterns than those who do.

## 5.1 Test scores analysis

**Data:** 100, 100, 99, 98, 92, 91, 91, 90, 88, 87, 87, 85, 85, 85, 80, 79, 76, 72, 67, 66, 45

### a) What is the average score (mean)?

(100+100+99+98+92+91+91+90+88+87+87+85+85+85+80+79+76+72+67+66+45) / 21 = 1735 / 21 = **82.62**

### b) Is the sequence in ascending or descending order?

**Descending order** (from highest to lowest)

### c) Determine the median score

Sorted list: 45, 66, 67, 72, 76, 79, 80, 85, 85, 85, 87, 87, 88, 90, 91, 91, 92, 98, 99, 100, 100

The 11th value in the ordered list of 21 scores = **87**

### d) Describe James's (90) and Petrus's (79) results in relation to the mean

- James's score (90) is **above the mean** (82.62)
- Petrus's score (79) is **below the mean**

### e) What is the 'range' of the scores?

Range = Highest score - Lowest score = 100 - 45 = **55**

## 5.2 Age analysis of class

### 5.2.1 Planning phase

**Method:** The quickest way is to ask every learner to verbally state their age and record it publicly (e.g., on a whiteboard). To ensure accuracy, we ask for their age in whole years as of their last birthday. This method is transparent and allows for immediate verification by the group.

### 5.2.2 Calculate the average age (mean)

**Data:** 18, 18, 18, 21, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 24, 24, 26, 27, 27, 27, 28, 29

**Mean = 23**

### 5.2.3 Calculate the median (ascending order)

**Data:** 18, 18, 18, 21, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 24, 24, 26, 27, 27, 27, 28, 29

**Median = 23**

### 5.2.4 Analyse data - What conclusions can you reach?

Most learners are in their mid-20s and the range between the youngest and oldest is 9 years.

### 5.2.5 Reflect on the process

**Was it effective?** The process was effective because we managed to get more than 80% learners to answer and get the ages.

**Were respondents cooperative?** The respondents were cooperative but not willing to write their actual ages.

**What would you do differently?** Next time it shouldn't be anonymous; find a way to make sure everyone writes their correct ages.

## 6.1 Draw a pie chart

**Data:**
- Absenteeism due to transport problems: 108°
- Absenteeism due to illness: 162°
- Absenteeism due to training: 45°
- Absenteeism due to family commitments: 45°

**Title:** Causes of Employee Absenteeism

## 6.2 Examples of workplace data representation

**a) Bar Chart:** Comparing the monthly sales figures of different product lines.

**b) Line Chart:** Tracking the company's stock price over the course of a year.

**c) Scatter Diagram:** Analyzing the relationship between the number of training hours employees receive and their subsequent productivity scores.

## 7.1 Explain how the representative sample grew from 4.7 million (STEE) to 6.559 (SEE) to 7.075 million (QES)

The sample frame (the list of businesses from which the sample is drawn) has been progressively improved. The STEE used an initial, less complete business register. The SEE used a better register based on VAT-registered businesses (turnover >R300k). The QES uses the most comprehensive register, based on all businesses registered for income tax, which includes many small businesses that the previous surveys missed. This extended coverage is why the employment estimate increased.

## 7.2 What categories of workers have been excluded from QES and why?

Working proprietors and own-account workers have been excluded. This was done to align with International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions, which separate "employees" from "employers" and "own-account workers." This exclusion allows for a more meaningful and accurate calculation of average monthly earnings specifically for employees.

## 7.3 Information regarding employers, employees and the self-employed

### a) What is the frequency of these surveys?

**Six-monthly** (twice a year / every six months)

### b) Why should they be conducted frequently?

The labour market is dynamic. Frequent surveys are needed to track changes in employment, unemployment, and self-employment trends in a timely manner to inform policy and business decisions.

### c) What is the size of the sample?

**30,000 households**

### d) Do you think it is a representative sample?

Yes, it is designed to be representative. A sample of 30,000 households is very large and, if selected correctly (e.g., using stratified random sampling), can accurately represent the national population.

### e) What are some problems regarding choosing a sample of this nature?

- Costly and complex to administer
- Ensuring the sample is truly random and representative of all geographic and demographic groups
- Non-response bias (if certain types of households refuse to participate)

## 7.4 What are the limitations of a time series that has only two data points?

With only two data points, it is impossible to identify a reliable trend or pattern. The change between the two points could represent the start of a new long-term trend, or it could just be a short-term fluctuation, seasonal variation, or a random anomaly. You need multiple data points over time to smooth out variability and identify a true underlying trend.
